# Flutter Web LocalStorage Example
Example code for my write-up "Harnessing the power of localStorage API in Flutter WebÂ App". It uses [window.localStorage](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.5.0/dart-html/Storage-class.html) API for persisting [brightness](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData/brightness.html) property of [ThemeData](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html).
